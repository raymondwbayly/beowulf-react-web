## The Beowulf Platform is a suite of prototype applications giving a developer the ability to see an entire production suite of applications as they work together, allowing them the ability to look at the code for examples and to see the performance and abilities of the language, architecture and interdependency between the applications.

## The Beowulf Prototype comes with multiple applications allowing you to run and test a proof of concept system (All utilizing the [Beowulf Node.JS Server](https://github.com/raymondwbayly/beowulf_mse_server))
